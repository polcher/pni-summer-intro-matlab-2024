%% Exercise 1
% 1. Create an array of integers going from 20 to 1 with a step of 2. 
% 2. Find what integer goes under index 4. 
% 3. Find an index of integer 4. 


%% Exercise 2
% 1. create a 3X4 matrix using rand.
% 2. find indices of the elements more or equal to 0.5
% 3. replace these elements with nan.


% * replace all the numbers in your matrix which are bigger than 0.5 with
% 100. Do not use find. 


%% Exercise 3
% create a matrix of 10X10 randi up to value 10.
% find indices of elements bigger than 3 and smaller than 7. 
% find indices of elements either smaller than 2 or bigger than 9. 
% make it a function receiving a matrix as an input and output two arrays
% of indices. 

%% Exercise 4
% 1. How to test if at least any of the elements in a matrix are not 0? 
%2. How to test if all the elements in a matrix are not 0?
