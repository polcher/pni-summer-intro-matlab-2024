%% Exercise 1
% Generate a 4-element array of random integers. 

% Write an if statement that returns "The sum is ___ and it is 
% greater than 20" if the sum of the array is greater than 20, 
% or “The sum is ___ and it is less than 20” if the sum of the 
% array is less than 20.


%% Exercise 2
% Generate a 4-element array of random integers. 

% % Write an if statement that returns "The sum is ___ and it is 
% greater than 20" if the sum of the array is greater than 20, 
% “The sum is ___ and it is less than 20” if the sum of the 
% array is less than 20, or "The sum is 20" if the sum of the array
% is 20.

%% Exercise 3
% Generate a 5-element array of random integers.

% Write a while loop where for each element of the array, if the 
% element is greater than 5 or equal to 1, return the element.


%% Exercise 4
% Rewrite your code from Exercise 3, but using a for loop.


%% Exercise 5
% Generate two random 3x4 matrices consisting of integers
% between -6 and 6.



% Write a nested for loop that creates a new 3x4 matrix called 
% `sum_matrix` that contains the sum of the two matrices.
